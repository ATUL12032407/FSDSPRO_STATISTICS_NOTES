Probability is nothing but relative frequency.

*Definition*:-(Refer Pdf Notes)

*Properties :-

(i)- 0<=P(A)<=1

(ii)- Σ P(A)=1 

(iii)- P(A U B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A ∩ B)

*Independent event means two event doesn't affect each other.Independent event can be disjoint but both are different.

*Conditional Probability*:- P(A/B)=P(A ∩ B)/P(B) , P(B/A)=P(A ∩ B)/P(A)

*If A and B are independent then P(A/B)=P(A)*P(B)
