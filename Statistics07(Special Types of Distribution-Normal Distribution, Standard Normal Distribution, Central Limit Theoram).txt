Normal Distribution :- Most of the naturally occuring / human generated data follow a normal distribution.

Empirical rule or figure :- 67.5%-95%-99.7% 

It will help to understand the distribution of the data.

It help us to know the outliers of data.

Q1-Q3 we choose because maximum number of values lies between Q1-Q3(68%).Outliers will be low in proportion. Data lies outside -3σ and 3σ will be outliers.

Exp:- Height of people , Weight of people , Measurement of error ,  Score of game , Blood Pressure.

Remark:- Mean is not 0 and S.D. is not 1 in case of normal distribution.

**Industry usecase of normal distribution:-

1. Beyond 3-S.D. it help you to identify the outliers.

2.Some ML. models required data to be normally distributed.Because most of natural data follow normal distribution.

*We use multiple transformations in Data enginnering based on the nature of the data. 

If you are modelling statistical ML Model then data should follow normal distribution and if not we do transformation mentioned below based on characteristic of data.


Right skewed data:- Log /Square
Left skewed data:- Reciprocal
-ve Valued data:- Yeo Johnson 
+ve Valued data:- Box- cox transformation 
Non-zero value:- Reciprocal transformation

*Mean and S.D. can be any real numbers.

*If N.D.-1 & N.D.-2 are two data points and N.D.-1 with mean 0 and s.d. =10 and if N.D.-2 with mean =100 and s.d. = 10.Which data is far away from µ ?

*Ans:- We can't say anything because scales of both the distributions are not same.For comparision we need to standardize it.
              We find Zscore (xi– µ)/σ and then this distribution is called standard normal distribution then we compare data D-1 & D-2.


*Standard normal distribution :- A normal distribution with mean =0  and S.D. =1 is called standard normal distribution. Whichever data point have highest Zscore that data point will be far from mean(µ). 

Ques:- (Refer pdf notes for Questions & Solutions), If Zscore is 3 it means the data point is 3SD far away from mean.But if Zscore is 10 it means the data point is  10SD far away from mean.  

** Zscore=3 & σ=3  Zscore = 3 means data point is 3SD away from mean.But σ=3 means each and every data point is on an average is 3cm away from mean. 

**If Zscore=20 & σ=3 then it means 60 units away from mean value if µ=50 then µ+σ will be 110.

*Industry usecase of standard normal distribution:-

1.Standardization
2.For different scale data there will be no problem in prediction but learning parameter will also be very much vary in terms of scale.Scaling will be optional.

**Scaling done in two ways:-

1.Standardization(Outliers)
2.Normalization(Min-max Scalar)

xnorm= xi-xmin/xmax-xmin

*Robust Scaling:- It removes the effect of outliers.

Ques:- Why we use scaling?
Ans:- We use for better interpretation and faster optimization(Gradient Descent).
 
 *Central Limit Theoram:- It helps to convert irregular or haphasard distribution into normal distribution.It converts any form of distribution to the normal distribution.

** C.L.T. states that if you have any population with µ & σ and  you take sufficiently large random sample from population with replacement then the distribution of sampling mean will be appromimately normally  distributed.

** Sampling mean of population (µ,σ) will be approximately to a normal  distribution.

Ques:- What is n? Why it happens? How many no. of sample should I take? What should be the value of n? What is usecase ?

Ans:- n is sample size here(50 in exp of pdf notes.)

**Condition of C.L.T:-

1.The sample size should be large enogh.

2.The sample size equal to and greater than 30(except if population is already in normal distribution.)

3.n>=30 because sampling mean follow Z-distribution. Zscore (xi– µ)/σ/_/n 

4. Take large number of sample as much as large untill approximation becomes normal distribution.

** Zscore (xi– µ)/σ If sample size <30 then it will follow t-distribution. If we apply C.L.T. to this distribution then  Zscore (xi– µ)/σ/_/n and then this distribution is called z-distribution provided sample size >=30 and if <30then it will called t-distribution.

Ques:- Why µ= µ and σ= σ/_/n ?

Ans:- µ= µ because the distribution will be replicated only so mean will be the mean itself. σ= σ/_/n because for sufficiently large sample size after applying C.L.T. it will follow standard normal distribution because we assumed µ=1 (in pdf notes example).  

Ques:-(Refer pdf notes)

Kurtosis:- There are three types of kurtosis.

(i)-Leptokurtic(k>3)
(ii)-Mesokurtic(k=3)
(iii)-Platykurtic(k<3)

*σ - is for population and we are using  to calculate Zscore but here we are using standardised.
