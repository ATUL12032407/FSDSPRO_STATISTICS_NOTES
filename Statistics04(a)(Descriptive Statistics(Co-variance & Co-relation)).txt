**Whatever you are going to predict it should have some relation with the features ?

Price of house ∝  Area of house, No. of rooms , Locality

How to measure the relationship ?

(i)-  Covariance
(ii)- Correlation

We know that Variance is measure of spread of data.

Scenario(i)- (Refer Pdf Notes)

Scenario(ii)- (Refer Pdf Notes)

(ii)- Variance :- The average of square distances from the mean.      
 
 Variance Formulas for Grouped Data:-
 
 The variance of a population for ungrouped data is:-   σ2 = ∑ (xi – x̄)2/n  
 
 Where, x̄ is the mean of population data set  & n is the total number of observations
 
 
**Formula for Sample Variance :-
 
 Sample Variance Formula for Ungrouped Data (σ2) = ∑ (xi – x̄)2/(n-1)
 
 
*Covariance*:- Co+Variance , It is used to determine the relationship between two variable. It means variance was nothing but the relationshp of feature with itself.
 
  Co-variance Formula of a Sample  for Ungrouped Data Cov(X,Y) = ∑ (xi – x̄)(yi -ȳ)/(n-1)
  
**Co-variance Formulas for Grouped Data:-
 
 The Co-variance of a population for ungrouped data is:-   Cov(X,Y) = ∑ (xi – x̄)(yi -ȳ)/n  
 
 Where, x̄ is the mean of population data set X and ȳ  is the mean of population data set Y & n is the total number of observations
  
Exp:- (Refer Pdf Notes)  It means two variable x & y are negatively related(inversly relation).

*If Cov(x,y)>0 It means two variable x & y are positively related(inversly relation).

*Disadvantage of Co-variance*:- 

(i)- Since co-variance has a dimension so magnitude will make no sense i.e. if dimensions are different we can't compare magnitude.

(ii)- Co-variance Range = (-∞,+∞)


*Co-relation* :- It is defined as  Correlation,ρ(X,Y) = Cov(X,Y)/σX*σy and Co-relation Range = [-1,1]. CO-relation is dimensionless quantity.

*If co-relation value in [-1,0] then -vely co-related and if co-relation value in [0,1] then +vely co-related.

Ques:- If co-relation value for x,y =0.4 and co-relation value for A,B =0.8 how  they are co-related?

Ans:- (Refer Pdf Notes) How much sure it is that if there is 1 unit change in x the other unit will also change.

**(Refer Pdf Notes for next example) For both the data point co-relation is 1 means perfect co-relation i.e.if there is 1 unit change in x there is 100% chance that y will also get changed.

** The formula is called as Pearson Co-relation.The pearson co-relation always measures linear relationship.

**Second one is Spearman Rank Co-relation.It is used for non-linear relationship.

Exp:-(Refer Pdf Notes)

**We always use Pearson Co-relation in Data Science.

** If co-relation value between .3 & 1 or -.3 & -1 thn we say it is good co-relation.
